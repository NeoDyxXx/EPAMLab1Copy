[Intro: Chris Musser]
I just don't care, don't care anymore
​
[Verse 1: Chris Musser]
​I just don't care anymore and I can't pretend
​I haven't been here before and haven't seen the end
​I sometimes hope for a cure, I'm just lost within
​I just don't care anymore, why can't I win?

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Brandyberry]
I open my eyes and these lies, they breed and they feed off of me
​I try to revive a design but can't see a need to agree
​I'd hide in my mind and rewind the scene or I'd flee underneath
​But time after time I still find I bleed more for me to succeed
​
[Chorus: Chris Musser]
​It's hard to care care care if I'm breaking now
Every single thing I swear tries to take me down
​It's hard to care care care if I make it out
Every single thought of despair tries to take me down
​
[Verse 2: Chris Musser]
​I'm keeping myself alive to just live like this
And force myself to decide what's my life's purpose
​I'm stuck in back of the line and behind the mix
Still trying to find what is mine, find where I fit

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Brandyberry]
I open my eyes and these lies, they breed and they feed off of me
​I try to revive a design but can't see a need to agree
​I'd hide in my mind and rewind the scene or I'd flee underneath
​But time after time I still find I bleed more for me to succeed

[Chorus: Chris Musser]
​It's hard to care care care if I'm breaking now
Every single thing I swear tries to take me down
​It's hard to care care care if I make it out
Every single thought of despair tries to take me down

[Bridge: Matt Brandyberry]
All the time it's trying to break me
Every lie is trying to take me
Now I find I'm dying to save me
But down inside I care a little less lately
All the time it's trying to break me
Every lie is trying to take me
Now I find I'm dying to save me
But down inside I care a little less lately
All the time it's trying to break me
Every lie is trying to take me
Now I find I'm dying to save me
But down inside I care a little less lately
All the time it's trying to break me
Every lie is trying to take me
Now I find I'm dying to save me
But down inside I care a little less lately

[Chorus: Chris Musser]
​It's hard to care care care if I'm breaking now
Every single thing I swear tries to take me down
​It's hard to care care care if I make it out
Every single thought of despair tries to take me down

[Outro: Matt Brandyberry]
All the time it's trying to break me
Every lie is trying to take me
Now I find I'm dying to save me
But down inside I care a little less lately
All the time it's trying to break me
Every lie is trying to take me
Now I find I'm dying to save me
But down inside I care a little less lately
